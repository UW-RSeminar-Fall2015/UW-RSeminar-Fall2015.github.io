{"name":"UW Biology R Seminar - Fall 2015","tagline":"Where to go for the syllabus, schedule, and contact info","body":"### Welcome to R-Seminar\r\nThis weekly \"self-help\" course will allow us to share knowledge about scientific computing using the R language.\r\n\r\n### How the seminar typically works\r\nEach week one person presents on a topic (typically something they have some experience with) usually by first giving a short presentation on that topic and then walking the participants through an example script. Topics are whatever people are interested in learning and are usually picked during the first seminar of the quarter. In the past, we've covered things like generalized linear models, mixed effects models, multiple comparison tests, quantile regression, bootstrapping, GIS, making pretty figures, and others. We've also done \"data workshops\", where someone will bring in their dataset and the group will brainstorm ways of analyzing and presenting it. Folks who at least have a basic knowledge of R going in (can read data into R, make some kind of graph, do a simple statistical test like a t-test) will probably get the most out of the seminar, but I will do a brief R crash-course at the beginning of the seminar if there is interest.\r\n\r\n### Accessing seminar materials\r\nWe will host all of the seminar materials on the seminar's [GitHub Organization Page](https://github.com/UW-RSeminar-Fall2015/)\r\n\r\n### Weekly Schedule\r\nAll meetings will be held in Hitchcock 312 from 3:30 - 4:20pm.\r\n\r\nDate  \t| Leader\t|  Topic\r\n------- | ----- \t| -------------\r\n10 / 6  | Ian \t\t| Seminar Organization\r\n10 / 13\t| Ian \t\t| Code Management / GitHub\r\n10 / 20\t| tba\t\t| tba\r\n10 / 27\t| tba \t\t| tba\r\n11 / 3 \t| tba \t\t| tba\r\n11 / 10\t| tba \t\t| tba\r\n11 / 17\t| tba \t\t| tba\r\n11 / 24\t| tba \t\t| tba\r\n12 / 1 \t| tba \t\t| tba\r\n12 / 8 \t| tba \t\t| tba\r\n\r\n### Instructions for presenters\r\ntbd\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThe primary organizer of this seminar is Ian Breckheimer (ibreckhe@uw.edu, @ibreckhe), but individual seminar participants are responsible for the content they upload.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
